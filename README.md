### Hi, I'm Igor! 👋

I pixelate reality by mixing code, vibes, and pixels.

I'm currently focused on [Collider.JAM](http://collider.land) -
a JavaScript game framework optimized for game jamming, prototyping, creative coding, and beyond.
I'm looking for collaborators, who want to simplify development toolchains.
