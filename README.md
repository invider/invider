### Hi, I'm Igor! 👋

I turn ideas into fun and playable code.
And pixelate reality by mixing code, vibes, and pixels.

Currently focused on [Collider.JAM](http://collider.land) -
a hand-crafted JavaScript game framework optimized for game jamming, prototyping,
rapid game development and creative coding among other things.
I'm looking for likeminded collaborators, who prefer light-weight text-based web-first tools over an IDE-style development.

⚡ I love UNIX!

⚡ I'm coding for as long, as I can remember and working in software development since the year 2000.

⚡ Besides GitHub, you can check my activity on
